# fsck-spaces

*fsck spaces* is a tool for finding and fixing a common error found in programming source code: The use of spaces for indentation.

These errors are found and recursively replaced with the correct usage of tabs.

By default, the following list of file extensions will be fixed: `js, ts, jsx, tsx, json, css`, as the scourge appears to most prevalently afflict those files used by web developers.

To add to this list you can call `fsck-spaces --more=cpp,h,whatever`
